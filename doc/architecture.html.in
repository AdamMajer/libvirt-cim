    <h1>Architecture</h1>

    <p>
      The libvirt-cim provider consists of two major parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The provider classes themselves (<tt>src/</tt>)
      </li>
      <li>
        A helper library of common components (<tt>libxkutil/</tt>)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The provider classes implement the actual CIM class model.  Some of
      the provider libraries implement one CIM class and one providier.
      However, many of them perform more than one task.  For example,
      the <tt>Virt_Device</tt> and <tt>Virt_DevicePool</tt> providers
      implement the device and device pool classes for each of the major
      device types: Memory, Processor, Network, and Disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The helper library contains common routines that almost all of the
      providers use, such as libvirt connection type detection and device
      and system XML parsing.
