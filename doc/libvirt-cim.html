<h3>What is <span class="style1">libvirt-cim?</span></h3>

<p>Libvirt-CIM is a CIM provider for managing linux virtualization
  platforms using libvirt.  It is written in C and should work in any
  CIMOM that supports CMPI 2.0 providers.  The intent is to implement
  the SVPC virtualization class model currently available in the DMTF
  Experimental 2.16 schema.

<h2><a name="Introducti">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Libvirt-CIM is a CIM provider for managing linux virtualization
  platforms using libvirt.  It is written in C and should work in any
  CIMOM that supports CMPI 2.0 providers.  The intent is to implement
  the SVPC virtualization class model currently available in the DMTF
  Experimental 2.16 schema.
</p>

<p>The providers are currently under heavy development.  Focus is on
  Xen support right now, which means some of the providers have some
  "shortcuts" hard-coded to Xen right now.  The long-term goal is to
  support all of the platforms that libvirt supports with minimal
  differences.

<p>The libvirt-cim development tree can be found in the
  <a href="http://libvirt.org/hg">libvirt.org/hg</a> repository.
</p>

<p>To get a copy of the development tree, use 
  <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">mercurial</a>'s
  clone feature:
</p>

<p><code>$ hg clone http://libvirt.org/hg/libvirt-cim</code></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can grab a 
  <a href="http://libvirt.org/hg/libvirt-cim/archive/tip.tar.gz">tarball</a> or 
  <a href="http://libvirt.org/hg/libvirt-cim/archive/tip.zip">zip</a>
  file snapshot of the repository.
</p>

<h2><a name="Schema">Schema</a></h2>

<p>The libvirt-cim provider depends on an installed 
  <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/cim_schema_v216/">DMTF
  CIM v2.16</a> Experimental schema.  The package can be obtained
<a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/cim_schema_v216/cimv216Experimental-MOFs.zip">here</a>.</p>

<h4>To install the schema in Pegasus:</h4>

<p><code>
  $ PEGASUS_REPO=/var/lib/Pegasus # adjust this as needed<br/>
  $ mkdir cim216<br/>
  $ cd cim216<br/>
  $ unzip $PATH_TO_ZIPFILE<br/>
  $ sudo cimmofl -uc -aEV -R$PEGASUS_REPO -n /root/ibmsd cimv216.mof<br/>
  $ sudo cimmofl -uc -aEV -R$PEGASUS_REPO -n /root/ibmsd qualifiers.mof<br/>
  $ sudo cimmofl -uc -aEV -R$PEGASUS_REPO -n /root/ibmsd qualifiers_optional.mof<br/>
</code></p>

<h4>To install the schema in SFCB:</h4>

<p><code>
  $ SFCB_CIM=/usr/local/share/sfcb/CIM # adjust this as needed<br/>
  $ mkdir cim216<br/>
  $ cd cim216<br/>
  $ unzip $PATH_TO_ZIPFILE<br/>
  $ mv cimv216.mof CIM_Schema.mof<br/>
  $ sudo cp * $SFCB_CIM<br/>
  $ sudo sfcbrepos<br/>
</code></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> in both cases, the CIM v2.16 schema seems to have a
    few classes that don't register correctly.  You may need to
    disable installation of classes with something like the
    following:

<h2><a name="Platforms">Platform Support</a></h2>

<p>Currently, libvirt-cim is targetting Xen as its primary support
  platform because is has the largest installed user base.  The
  long-term plan is to support many others (hopefully any that libvirt
  supports).  This includes KVM and containers.
</p>

<p>The code base currently has many Xen-specific "shortcuts" that need
  to be resolved and generalized in order to support other platforms.
  A short list of these may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The XML generation and parsing code and the related device
    modeling code.</li>
  <li>The libvirt connection logic.  Right now, (in most places) we
    detect the current hypervisor in use and connect to libvirt
    appropriately.  This may or may not be the correct behavior in a
    situation where you could need to support containers and QEMU
    virtual machines.</li>
  <li>Some lingering hard-coded "Xen_Foo" class names.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>Further, supporting new platforms have some registration and
  modeling implications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Additions to the MOF and registration files for "branded"
    classes (Xen_Foo, KVM_Foo, etc)</li>
  <li>Modifications to some of the association providers that register
    separate CMPI provider structures for each class type they handle
    (to avoid duplicate results in the general case)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="architecture">Architecture</a></h2>

<p>The libvirt-cim provider consists of two major parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The provider classes themselves (<tt>src/</tt>)</li>
  <li>A helper library of common components (<tt>libxkutil/</tt>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The provider classes implement the actual CIM class model.  Some of
  the provider libraries implement one CIM class and one providier.
  However, many of them perform more than one task.  For example,
  the <tt>Virt_Device</tt> and <tt>Virt_DevicePool</tt> providers
  implement the device and device pool classes for each of the major
  device types: Memory, Processor, Network, and Disk.
</p>

<p>The helper library contains common routines that almost all of the
  providers use, such as libvirt connection type detection and device
  and system XML parsing.
