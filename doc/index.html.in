    <h1>What is <strong>libvirt-cim</strong>?</h1>
    <p>
      Libvirt-CIM is a CIM provider for managing linux virtualization platforms 
      using libvirt. It is written in C and should work in any CIMOM that 
      supports CMPI 2.0 providers. The intent is to implement the SVPC 
      virtualization class model currently available in the DMTF Experimental 
      2.16 schema.

      The providers are currently under heavy development. Focus is on Xen 
      support right now, which means some of the providers have some "shortcuts" 
      hard-coded to Xen right now. The long-term goal is to support all of the 
      platforms that libvirt supports with minimal differences.
