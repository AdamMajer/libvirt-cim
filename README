       libvirt-cim : A CIM provider for libvirt

Libvirt-cim is a CMPI CIM provider that implements the DMTF SVPC
virtualization model.  It is free software available under the GNU
Lesser General Public License.  The goal is to support most of the
features exported by libvirt itself, enabling management of multiple
platforms with a single provider.

The latest version of the library can be found here:
